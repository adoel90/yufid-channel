          <p>When we speak with nonprofit organizations, we often hear about the challenges related to technological resources. So when it comes to investing in new technology, it’s important to consider three primary factors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Security: Does it keep my information private and secure?<br></li>
            <li>Compatibility: Does it work with the programs I use?<br></li>
            <li>Price: Is it within budget?<br></li>
          </ul>To address these questions, Google created the Chromebook, a series of laptops built with ChromeOS. The vision behind Chromebooks is simple — to create a safe, accessible, and affordable laptop. To improve user privacy and security, Chromebooks
          &nbsp;automatically update to provide virus protection, encryption and safe browsing. For easy access and collaboration, they’re outfitted with Gmail, Google Docs, Hangouts (and nonprofits receive the full Google Apps bundle with 30GB of space
          per user at no charge). What’s more, they start at $169 USD &amp; that’s for a laptop that has up to 10+ hours of battery life!<br></div>
